For CS 440 test. My justification here:

For the license type that I chose for this repository is the GNU General Public License v3.0. This copyleft license is intended to guarantee freedom in terms of sharing and/or changing the software so it remains to be available to all users. According to Github, this license requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms, and also provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users. This is basically the terms under copyleft.Courts have said a person can sue for an injunction against someone who uses copylefted software without following the open source licensing agreement. Free software provides the right to study and modify software entails access to its source code.
